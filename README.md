# Ni4-Cluster-Structure-Files

This repository contains all of the XYZ files for the paper *Computational and Experimental Characterization of the Ligand Environment of a Ni-Oxo Catalyst Supported in the Metal-Organic Framework NU-1000*. The files are the converged geometries from CP2K for the Ni4-cluster. 

The repository is organized according to the following: 
* [00-Phase-Diagram-and-Key-Structures](https://github.com/getman-research-group/Ni4-Cluster-Structure-Files/tree/main/00-Phase-Diagram-and-Key-Structures): All of the structures appearing on the phase diagram and the key structures based on dPDF
* [01-Less-Than-100-kJmol-Structures](): All of the structures within 100 kJ/mol of the lowest energy configuration 
* [02-All-Structures](): All of the structures generated during modeling
* [03-Sample-Input-Files](https://github.com/getman-research-group/Ni4-Cluster-Structure-Files/tree/main/03-Sample-Input-Files): Sample input files for each CP2K calculation
  * GEO_OPT.inp :
  * FREQUENCY.inp :
  * BASIS_file:
  * POTENTIALS_file :
  * dftd3.dat :
