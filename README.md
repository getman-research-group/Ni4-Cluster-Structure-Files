# Ni4-Cluster-Structure-Files

This respository contains all of the XYZ files for the paper ("INSERT PAPER NAME HERE). The files are the converged geometries from CP2K for the Ni4-cluster. The repository is organized according to the following: 
* [00-Phase-Diagram-and-Key-Structures](https://github.com/getman-research-group/Ni4-Cluster-Structure-Files/tree/main/00-Phase-Diagram-and-Key-Structures): All of the structures appearing on the phase diagram and the key structures based on dPDF
* [01-Less-Than-100-kJmol-Structures](): All of the structures within 100 kJ/mol of the lowest energy configuration 
* [02-All-Structures](): All of the structures generated during modeling
