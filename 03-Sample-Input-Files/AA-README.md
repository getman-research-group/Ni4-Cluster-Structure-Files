# Instructions

The *inp* files will need to be manipulated with the correct multiplicity and UKS status to run a calculation. 
This information is contained in the filename. A few examples:

| Filename                                     | Multiplicity  | UKS Status      |
| :---                                         |    :----:     |          ---:   |
| 001_Zr18_C264_Ni4_O102_H188_RKS-multi1.xyz   | 1             | False           |
| 027_Zr18_C264_Ni3_O98_H182_UKS-multi7.xyz    | 7             | True            |
| 052_Zr18_C264_Ni4_O106_H192_UKS-multi9.xyz   | 9             | True            |

Additionally, the only file that needs to be manipulated is the *inp* file. The other files are just parameter files
that do not need to be adjusted.
